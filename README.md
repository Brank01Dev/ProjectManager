# ProjectManager

My first Laravel project — built for learning purposes.  
This is a simple educational exercise without CSS styling yet, and it still needs more work.  
The goal was to practice Laravel basics and get comfortable with its structure.

## 🔍 What it is

**ProjectManager** is a simple Laravel app that demonstrates:

- Setting up and configuring a Laravel project  
- Using routes, controllers, and models  
- Database migrations  
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete records)  
- Blade templates for views  

It’s a practice project.
